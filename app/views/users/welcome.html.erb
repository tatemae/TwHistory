  <p>Welcome to TwHistory, and thanks for joining.</p>
  <p>TwHistory is currently in beta, so we are very interested in your feedback. If you run into any problems, or have questions, please <a href="http://twhistory.org/stay-in-touch/">contact us</a>.
  <p>Now that you have created an account, there are several things you can do. You can create your own reenactment, invite others to participate, or follow reenactments already taking place.
  To start your own TwHistory re-enactment, click on the Create a Re-enactment button on the right side of the page. Give your re-enactment a name and description. 
  You can then either add tweets manually, or upload an excel spreadsheet with the content. To download a blank spreadsheet to use as an example, click here.</p>
