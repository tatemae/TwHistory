  <h1>Welcome to TwHistory</h1>

  <p>We believe that history is filled with exciting stories. We also believe that these stories can be told by 
    creating virtual reenactments using Twitter, a popular micro-blogging service that allows 140 character 'tweets'.</p>
  
  <p>The process is simple. Students or volunteers pick a well-documented historical event. They pick real historical figures 
    who were at that event, and create tweets based on original source documentation. These tweets are then scheduled to be 
    broadcast in real time. The end result is a virtual reenactment of a historical event, broadcast in real time.</p>
  
  <p>These virtual reenactments allow a new way to experience history. Instead of reading about a month-long campaign 
  in just a few hours, followers experience the campaign over the course of a month, all in real time. 
  Together, the separate tweets combine to paint a complete and unique picture of a small segment of history.</p>
