6/15/2010,10:35 AM,George A. Smith,More wagons to get across the river. Swimming some stock over today.,
6/15/2010,10:59 AM,Erastus Snow,The difficulty of pulling a raft in so deep and swift water sweeps them down river one to two miles before it makes the other shore.,
6/15/2010,11:03 AM,Levi Jackman,We crossed what we could but the watter was quite high and rizing The River at this place is about 1/2 of a mile wide and runs fast,
6/15/2010,12:22 PM,Heber Kimball,"Bro Crow sent his animals to swim across, but they neglected to take off the lariat from the horses. Buffalo horse appears to be drowning.",

6/15/2010,4:23 PM,George A. Smith,Quite a number of loads and wagons got over all safe. One of R. Crow’s Indian ponies got tangled in a rope and drowned.,
6/15/2010,4:38 PM,Heber Kimball,We decided to leave some men behind to wait for more brethren and help them ferry across. They'll earn money by ferrying gentile companies.,
6/15/2010,4:49 PM,Appleton Harmon,"We built a larger raft, and that seemed to help. An Oregon company of 18 waggons commanded by Capt Smith came, & employed us to ferry them.",
6/15/2010,6:16 PM,Heber Kimball,Word came that a large company is near. If this be true they're doubtless brethren. We have hopes they'll overtake us before we get through.,
6/16/2010,8:44 AM,Heber Kimball,Some back abt 3 mi to make 2 canoes and build a good raft or a ferry on them. Others upriver digging & making puncheons to lay on the raft.,
